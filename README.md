# "Striped" by HTML5Up
The HTML5 Up "[Striped](https://html5up.net/striped)" theme, converted to [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com).  
Single index file from the HTML5Up template, broken down in to easier to manage chunks (e.g. partials) for Middleman.        

It may not be pretty, but the theme creation is part of my effort to learn more Ruby.

Customizable [Sidebar](source/partials/_sidebar.slim) & [navigation](source/partials/_nav.slim) links.  
Optional "Featured Image" for posts
Social sharing for posts (e.g., readers -- or you -- can share posts to twitter, facebook, reddit, email et al).  
Fancy shmancy ordinal dates.  
Several options configurable in `data/site.yml`: 
* Site URL (*because it makes my poor code work with the social sharing options and I'm okay with that*)
* Site name/title
* Site subtitle
* Google Analytics.  

(There is a "read time" helper but I opted to  not use it at this time -- it's commented out in [index.html.erb](source/index.html.erb))

And here's a new one: Striped, which features a clean, minimalistic design, styling for
all basic page elements (including blockquotes, tables and lists), a repositionable
sidebar (left or right), and HTML5/CSS3 code designed for quick and easy customization
(see code comments for details).
